Phylogenetics Workshop

As an example, I will use a sample of the genus Gliocladiopsis (Nectriaceae, 
Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes) that includes species closely related to some of the fungi 
from the Panama seed project.

# Before lab meeting - construct ITS phylogeny using given sequence alignment
#########################################################################################

Some commonly used tools for aligning sequences and building phylogenies are available
through the CIPRES web portal, an NSF-funded resource based at UCSD. If you don't already
have an account with CIPRES, please create one by following the link below. If you
already have an account you can skip to (1.) below.

http://www.phylo.org/sub_sections/portal/

Follow the link to use the CIPRES science gateway and you will be taken to a screen
to log in or register a new account.

CIPRES organizes projects into FOLDERS. In each FOLDER, you can upload DATA, which you
then use to perform TASKS. TASKS use existing software such as sequence alignment and tree
reconstruction tools.

1. Create a new folder for the workshop called, "Lab workshop".

2. Using the navigator on the left side of the screen, click on "Data" in the
	Lab workshop folder. Click the link to Upload/Enter data, and upload the sequence
	alignment file, "gliocladiopsis_its_aligned_manual.fas". In addition to the taxon
	and gene that these sequences represent, the filename shorthand also tells you
	that the sequences are aligned, and have been verified manually by eye. I will review
	alignment during our meeting but for now know that the sequences are aligned and
	ready to use for tree building.
	
3. Using the navigator, click on "Tasks" in the Lab workshop folder. Click the link
	to Create a new task. Select the alignment file you uploaded as the input data. 
	Select "RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE" as the tool. Click the link to edit the input
	parameters. You can now see all of the parameters for RAxML.Change "Maximum hours 
	to Run" to 24. Change "Estimate proportion of invariable sites" to yes. Click the
	link to expand the advanced parameters. Change "Nucleic Acid Options" to GTRGAMMA.
	Under "Configure Bootstrapping", click the box to "Print branch lengths", and change
	"Bootstrap iterations" to 1000. Click the link to save parameters; you will see
	a prompt letting you know the maximum amount of time run will use - click OK; you will
	see another prompt telling you that Alexis doens't like the model of sequence
	evolution to include invariant sites - click OK. Give your task the description,
	"Gliocladiopsis ITS ML invariant" to indicate that our maximum likelihood run uses
	a model that includes invariant sites. Click outside of the description text box any
	where on the screen to set the description. Click Save and Run Task.
	
4. Once your task is complete, you will receive an email notification. You will also see
	a link to view output in the task summary list. In the output screen for our task,
	check boxes for all output files that begin with "RAxML_", there are five. Download
	the selected files and move them into the same directory as the alignment file.
	
5. We will use this tree during our meeting. If you would like to view your tree before 
	our meeting, I recommend using Figtree which works for PC and Mac and is free:
	
	http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/
	
	You can open the output file, "RAxML_bipartitions.result" using Figtree. Figtree
	will recognize the bootstrap values from the analysis and upload them when you open
	the file. You can turn these on using the Node Labels feature.

sequences
	glio_its.fas
		- fasta file with raw sequences
	glio_its_aligned.fas
		- fasta file with sequences after alignment in MUSCLE through CIPRES
	glio_its_aligned.nex
		- nexus file with aligned sequences showing manual editing in Mesquite
	glio_its_aligned_manual.fas
		- fasta file with aligned and manually edited sequences
	glio_its_modeltest.txt
		- results output from jModelTest
		
trees
	glio_its_MLinvar
		- maximum likelihood phylogeny inferred using RAxML through CIPRES
			- model of sequence evolution: general time reversible (GTR) with
				gamma rate change parameter and including invariant sites (I)
			- support: from 1,000 bootstrap replicates
				- note: phylogenetic bootstrapping is always with replacement
			- printed branch lengths
			- infer best tree simultaneously with bootstrap trees
			- comes with output files
				RAxML_bestTree.result
					- newick tree file of the best ML tree
				RAxML_bipartitions.result
					- newick tree file of the best ML tree with branch lengths and
						values from the bootstrap analysis stored
					- I use this one for viewing and downstream stuff
				RAxML_bipartitionsBranchLabels.result
					- same file as above because we argued to have branch lengths printed
						onto the tree when initiating the run
				RAxML_bootstrap.result
					- newick tree file with all bootstrap trees
				RAxML_info.result
					- information regarding the run

sequences: here are the same types of sequence files for ITS, RPB1, and TEF including
all sequences available on genbank, and also:
	glio_mlsa_aligned_manual.nex
		- nexus file with aligned and manually edited sequences for individual genes
			contatenated into a supermatrix
	glio_mlsa_aligned_manual.fas
		- fasta file version of the above nexus file
	glio_mlsa_partitions.txt
		- text file with partitions formatted for RAxML
	
trees: here are the same types of tree files for ITS, RPB1, and TEF, and also that for
the MLSA (supermatrix approach) to compare with the final supertree. This supermatrix
is missing data for RPB1.

matrix representation with parsimony (MRP): here are files to conduct the supertree
analysis:
	- PAUP*
		- input file
			glio_supertrees.nex
				- nexus file with final trees
		- create MRP
		- input MRP
		- run heuristic parsimony search
		- examine individual trees and produce consensus tree
		- view tree in figtree

view alignment in Mesquite
	glio_mlsa_aligned_manual.nex

important step: congruence testing prior to concatenation
	- Partition homogeneity test in PAUP*
		- upload data file
			glio_mlsa_aligned_manual.nex
		- input partitions
			glio_mlsa_partitions_notes.txt
		- run partition homogeneity test

alternative: topology testing
	- Many tests available in PAUP* (tree scores)
		- upload tree data file
		- root trees
		- upload matrix data file
		- analyze tree scores
